## Prerequisites
* [.NET Core 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

## Usage
1. Download the latest release from https://github.com/lahm86/tomb3_ConfigTool/releases/latest. You can choose the 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) version to best match your setup.
2. Place the tomb3_ConfigTool.exe file in the same directory as your tomb3 installation.
3. Launch tomb3_ConfigTool.exe.
4. Change as many settings as desired. Press `Save` to write these values to disk so that tomb3 can read them.
5. Shortcut buttons are provided to launch the game:
   * Use the `Launch Setup` button to open the original setup window.
   * Use the `Launch tomb3` button to start the normal game.
   * Use the `Launch Gold` button to start the gold edition of the game (The Lost Artefact).
6. Use the `Restore Defaults` button at any time to revert to the default settings.

Settings can also be exported and imported via the `Tools` menu options.

## Texture Tool
The GUI contains an option to launch an external texture modifying tool, [TRTextureReplace](https://github.com/lahm86/TRTextureReplace). Some settings work best with specific texture modifications in place.

## Configuration
The tool itself has a JSON configuration file, which stores the following values.
* `ExecutableName` - the name of the tomb3 executable file to launch using the shortcut buttons described above.
* `SetupArgs` - argument(s) to pass to the tomb3 executable used by the `Launch Setup` button.
* `GoldArgs` - argument(s) to pass to the tomb3 executable used by the `Launch Gold` button.
* `TextureExecutableName` - the name of the texture tool executable file to launch using Tools > Textures in the GUI.
